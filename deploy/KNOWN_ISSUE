1. Using "latest" as repo URL won't reflect the real version.
which led to "zypper up" to the new beta/rc version when
"latest" redirect to a new repo.

2. Install via `virt-install` with disk for autoyast
Current deploy is using:
virt-install \
...
--disk path=/xxx/SUSE-HA-openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Tumbleweed-i586-x86_64-Build2938.3-size20480-base.qcow2,size=20 \
--disk path=/xxx/SUSE-HA-tumbleweed-node1-autoyast.raw,bus=scsi         \
...
The 1st attached disk with virtIO is vda, the 2nd disk is sda with autoyast preload.
However, due to lack of partitioning/device defined in autoyast file,
the / will install on sda no matter how the order of this two disks attached.
To fix this, need to add `<device>/dev/vda</device>` in autoyast file
eg.  <device>/dev/vda</device> is added
```
  <partitioning config:type="list">
    <drive>
      <device>/dev/vda</device>
      <initialize config:type="boolean">true</initialize>
      <partitions config:type="list"/>
      <type config:type="symbol">CT_DISK</type>
      <use>all</use>
    </drive>
  </partitioning>
```
