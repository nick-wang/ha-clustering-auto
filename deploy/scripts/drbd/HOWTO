#1) Create the virt-io disks, running at 'host' machine
addVirioDisk.sh ./nodeconf 2 `pwd` 3G

#2) Partitioning the new created disks, running at every working node
make_part_drbd.sh 2

#3) Continue if want to testing automatically, running at every working node
#   Need to manually configure the relationships of device/disk/meta-disk
configDRBD.sh /dev/vdb
configDRBD.sh /dev/vdc

#4) Start the first sync, running at every working node
firstInitDRBD.sh

#5) Add crm resource, running at every working node(isMaster can help to run at host1 only)
crmDRBD.sh

########### HOW TO CHANGE #############
1. No need to change the code of "addVirioDisk.sh",
  only change the input paras.
2. Change "make_part_drbd.sh" for the details partitioning layout.
3. Change the manually change section of "configDRBD.sh" based on the layout setting.
  Need to dup more scripts if different disks have different layout/resource.
4. No need to change "firstInitDRBD.sh"
5. Change "crmDRBD.sh" for custom crm resource.
