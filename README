This project is used to deploy a cluster, with some cases such as pacemaker-cts,
clustermd and so on. It is mainly writen by python and shell, and there something
you should notice to run this project.

Q. How to deploy a host server?

  1. Configure ntp-client: 
     server address: "clock.via.net"
  2. Install package "java".
  3. Add to jenkins server slave.
  4. Install package "zypper in python-PyYAML".
  5. Copy running scripts to host (Or maybe update via rpm?git).
     Copy ssh private key to host, mode 0600
  6. Install package "nmap"
  7. Modify /etc/ssh/ssh_config, add one line:
     StrictHostKeyChecking no
  8. Create a directory for storing vm images.
     Like /mnt/vm/xxxxx
  9. Modify libvirtd to support TCP.
  10. Add a virbr0 for NAT.
  11. Install python library junit-xml.
      For sles, need python-setuptools.
  12. Install python library python-psutil.
      For cleanVM, get cpu/mem usage.

A.To make the cmd 
"virsh -c qemu+tcp://host_ip/system", we have to modify 

listen_tls = 0
listen_tcp = 1
tcp_port = "16509"
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0"
auth_tcp = "none"

Overview of the project. The project has the following directories:

cleanVM/  deploy/  examples/  jenkins-monitor/

The cleanVM directory has scripts to clean vms and utils to get cpu usage, memory usage
ans disk usage. 
The deploy directory is the main part of this project, we deploy cluster
and run testcases based on the directory.
  -conf: the vm configuration files, and autoyast files.
  -cts: the scripts to configure and run pacemaker-cts
  -scripts: the scripts to install vms, configure cluster and so on.
  -ssh_keys: the ssh keys to make host login vm without password, and interaction between 
   vms without password
  -templete: stores template of configuration for the cluster

The jenkins-monitor directory stores scripts and monitor a url, and download the newest ISO
to local server.

This is just for the project configuration and description, we run it in jenkins so far, you need some
confiration in jenkins, for the configuration of jenkins, you can visit 147.2.207.237:8080.
